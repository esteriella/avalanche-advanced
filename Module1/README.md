# Avalanche-Advanced-Module1

## Overview

Let's transport ourselves into a thrilling world of blockchain-based gaming üïπÔ∏è and explore the creation of a DeFi Kingdom üè∞ clone on Avalanche. In this digital realm, players can collect, build, and battle with their digital assets, earning rewards through various game activities.

But how can you create this fantastical world on Avalanche? By utilizing the EVM Subnet, you can deploy your smart contracts to a custom chain with low fees and your own custom token. With this power, you can architect and customize your game as you see fit.
